## AcuityQuick
## In this app, you are able to manage hospital room assignments based on the medical acuity level of patients. It allows healthcare providers to efficiently allocate rooms, ensuring that patients receive the appropriate level of care promptly.
## BASIC INSTRUCTIONS
1. Starting in the app, select the 'Start Here' button, which will lead you to the Main Dashboard where all current room assignments are displayed.
2. Select the 'Add Room' button at the bottom right, which will take you to an empty Patient Details page with a form to fill out. Alternatively, selecting an already assigned patient will populate their details for review or update.
3. After entering room details, you can save the information. There's three slider(in the beta) where you can select the patients level of care, and each picker is associated with an acutiy score which gets updated. Once saved, this will update the acuity score as well as the gallery of rooms.
6. Notes-
   - Room details will not show up in the lists without being saved.
   - You cannot add treatments unless they are linked to a saved room.
